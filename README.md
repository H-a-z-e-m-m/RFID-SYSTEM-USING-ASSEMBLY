# RFID-SYSTEM-USING-ASSEMBLY
This project is a simple but efficient RFID-based attendance system built using the **PIC16F877A microcontroller**, an **RDM6300 RFID reader**, and a **16x2 LCD display**. Written entirely in **Assembly**, the system reads RFID tags via UART, verifies the input, checks the checksum, and displays the userâ€™s unique ID on the LCD.
